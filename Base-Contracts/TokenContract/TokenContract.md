#### How it works? 
>
> - A Token Price Derivatives Contract is a financial agreement that allows individuals or entities to speculate on the future price movement of a particular token or cryptocurrency. It provides a mechanism for investors to manage risk and potentially profit from the price fluctuations of the token.

> - The contract involves three key inputs: the current token price, the strike price, and the expiry date. The current token price refers to the market value of the token at the time the contract is established. The strike price is a predetermined price set in the contract, which serves as a reference point for determining the contract's outcome. The expiry date is the date on which the contract terminates, and the final settlement is determined.

> - In this context, the Token Price Derivatives Contract functions similarly to a property price derivatives contract. It closely observes the current token price and compares it with the strike price at the expiry date. If the current token price exceeds the strike price at the expiry date, the contract triggers a payment to the contract holder.

> - This type of contract offers various advantages and use cases. For instance, it allows investors to hedge against price volatility by taking positions that protect against potential losses. It also enables traders to speculate on the price movement of tokens without having to physically own or hold them. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for market participants to create customized investment strategies based on their price predictions.

> - By offering a mechanism to trade token price derivatives, this contract contributes to the overall liquidity and efficiency of the token market. It allows investors to access additional financial instruments that can diversify their portfolios and potentially generate returns. Moreover, it fosters market participation by attracting traders who are interested in leveraging their knowledge and expertise to profit from token price movements.

> - It's important to note that Token Price Derivatives Contracts are subject to regulatory frameworks and market conditions. Proper risk management and due diligence should be exercised when engaging in derivative trading. Traders and investors should carefully consider the potential risks and rewards associated with these contracts before participating in the market.

> - In conclusion, a Token Price Derivatives Contract provides a flexible and efficient way for individuals and institutions to engage with the token market. By leveraging price movements and predictions, traders can potentially generate profits and manage risk. This type of contract contributes to the overall development and maturation of the token ecosystem, providing additional avenues for investment and speculation.

#### Code Blocks and explanations:

- **"when": [...]:**
    > This line introduces another nested when block.
    > It indicates that this nested when block will be executed when the previous then block is triggered.

- "then": {...}:
    This line starts a then block within the nested when block.
    It specifies the actions to be taken when the event within the nested when block occurs.

- "token": {
                  "token_name": "Land2023-1",
                  "currency_symbol": "8bb3b343d8e404472337966a722150048c768d0a92a9813596c5338d"
                },

    "token_name": "Land2023-1": This line specifies the name of the token. In this case, the token is named "Land2023-1".

    "currency_symbol": "8bb3b343d8e404472337966a722150048c768d0a92a9813596c5338d": This line specifies the currency symbol of the token. The currency symbol is a unique identifier for the token, and it helps differentiate it from other tokens. The value provided here is a hexadecimal representation of the currency symbol.Tokens in Marlowe represent digital assets or currencies that can be transferred between parties. They can be used to simulate and model the behavior of real-world assets within the contract. The "token" block is commonly used when specifying token transfers or token-related actions in the contract logic.

- "to": { "party": { "role_token": "Land2023-0" } },
    "to": This field indicates the recipient of the token transfer.

    { "party": { "role_token": "Land2023-0" } }: This nested structure specifies the recipient as a party with the role token "Land2023-0".
    In Marlowe, parties are identified by role tokens, which act as unique identifiers for participants in the contract. The "role_token" field specifies the specific role token associated with the party. In this case, the role token is "Land2023-0".

 - "pay": 100, "from_account": { "role_token": "Land2023-0" }
    The code snippet "pay": 100, "from_account": { "role_token": "Land2023-0" } is used to specify the source of funds for a token transfer within the Marlowe contract. Let's break down its components:

    "pay": 100: This line indicates the amount of the token that will be transferred. In this case, the value is 100. It represents the quantity or value of the token being sent.

    "from_account": { "role_token": "Land2023-0" }: This line specifies the account from which the token will be transferred. The "role_token" field indicates the specific role token associated with the account. In this case, the role token is "Land2023-0".Hence contract signifies that 100 units of the token will be transferred from the account associated with the role token "Land2023-0". The specified amount will be deducted from the sender's account and transferred to the designated recipient as defined in the to field of the token transfer action.

-  "timeout_continuation": "close", "timeout": 1672511400000
    "timeout_continuation": "close": This line defines the action to be taken when the timeout specified in the contract is reached. In this case, the action is set to "close". The "close" action typically indicates that the contract execution will be terminated or concluded.

    "timeout": 1672511400000: This line sets the timeout value for the contract. The value specified here represents a timestamp in milliseconds. In this case, the timeout value is set to 1672511400000.When the specified timeout is reached during the execution of the contract, the action specified in "timeout_continuation" will be triggered. In this case, as it is set to "close", the contract will be closed or terminated when the specified timeout value is reached.
