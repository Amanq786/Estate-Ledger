EstateLedger is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize the real estate industry. Building on the Cardano blockchain, EstateLedger will leverage the power of smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized finance to create a more transparent, efficient, and accessible real estate market.
At the core of EstateLedger is a suite of smart contracts that manage various aspects of the real estate transaction process. These contracts handle everything from land acquisition and property development to token trading and profit distribution. By automating these processes with smart contracts, EstateLedger eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and speeds up the transaction process.
